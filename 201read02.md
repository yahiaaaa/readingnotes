# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

### Headings  "**h**"
HTML has six "levels" of
headings:

Browsers display the contents of
headings at different sizes. The
contents of an <h1> element is
the largest, and the contents of 
an <h6> element is the smallest.

### Paragraph   

To create a paragraph, surround
the words that make up the
paragraph with an opening **p**
tag and closing </p> tag.

### Bold & It alic

By enclosing words in the tags
**b** and </b> we can make
characters appear bold.

By enclosing words in the tags
**i** and </i> we can make
characters appear italic.

### Superscript & Subscript

* **sup**
The <sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript such
as the suffixes of dates or
mathematical concepts like
raising a number to a power such
as 22.


* **sub**
The <sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript. It is commonly
used with foot notes or chemical
formulas such as H20.


### Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules

**br** 
As you have already seen, the
browser will automatically show
each new paragraph or heading
on a new line. But if you wanted
to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can
use the line break tag 

**hr**
To create a break between
themes — such as a change of
topic in a book or a new scene
in a play — you can add a
horizontal rule between sections
using the  tag

<hr/>

* **Visual editors** often resemble
word processors. Although
each editor will differ slightly,
there are some features that
are common to most editors
that allow you to control the
presentation of text

* **Code views** show you the code
created by the visual editor so
you can manually edit it, or so
you can just enter new code
yourself. It is often activated
using a button with an icon
that says HTML or has angled
brackets. White space may be
added to the code by the editor
to make the code easier to read

# CSS

CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a **selector** and a **declaration**.

*selector* :
indicate which
element the rule applies to.
The same rule can apply to
more than one element if you
separate the element names
with commas.


*declaration* :
indicate how
the elements referred to in
the selector should be styled.
Declarations are split into two
parts (a property and a value),
and are separated by a colon.

***CSS Properties Affect
How El ements Are
Dis played***

CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon

* Usi ng Internal
***style***
You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing
them inside a <style> element,
which usually sits inside the
<head> element of the page.

* **Why use External
Style Sheets?**

When building a website there are several advantages to placing your
CSS rules in a separate style sheet

# JS

We will look at what the code on the right does
shortly, but for the moment note that:
* Each of the lines of code in green is a statement.
* The pink curly braces indicate the start and end
of a code block. (Each code block could contain
many more statements.

### COMMENTS  //
You should write comments to explain what your code does.
They help make your code easier to read and understand.
This can help you and others who read your code.

***WHAT IS A VARIABLE? ***

A script will have to temporarily
store the bits of information it
needs to do its job. It can store this
data in variables.

### Function method and object 

* Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task.

* Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.

* An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you.

* In an object, variables are known as properties of the
object; functions are known as methods of the object.

* Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.

* Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other.
