# Markdown

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown

You can use Markdown most places around GitHub:
>- Gists
>- Comments in Issues and Pull Requests
>- Files with the .md or .markdown extension

## GitHub Flavored Markdown

GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com

## Quoting code

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the command or Ctrl + e keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown
