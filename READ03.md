# CSS

![alt text](https://blog.logrocket.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CSS-3.png "title")
in this you will learn :
● Control the dimensions of your boxes

● Create borders around boxes

● Set margins and padding for boxes

● Show and hide boxes

_Box Dimensions_

div.box {
height: 300px;// height of box
width: 300px; // width of box
background-color: #bbbbaa;}
p {
height: 75%;
width: 75%;
background-color: #0088dd;

The most popular ways to 
specify the size of a box are 
to use pixels, percentages, or 
ems. Traditionally, pixels have 
been the most popular method 
because they allow designers to 
accurately control their size.

** limiting width **

td.description {

min-width: 450px;

max-width: 650px;

text-align: left;

padding: 5px;

margin: 0px;

Some page designs expand and 
shrink to fit the size of the user's 
screen. In such designs, the 
min-width property specifies 
the smallest size a box can be 
displayed at when the browser 
window is narrow, and the 
max-width property indicates 
the maximum width a box can 
stretch to when the browser 
window is wide.

** limiting wiheight **

h2, p {

width: 400px;

font-size: 90%;

line-height: 1.2em;}

h2 {

color: #0088dd;

border-bottom: 1px solid

#0088dd;}

p {

min-height: 10px;

max-height: 30px;

In the same way that you might 
want to limit the width of a box 
on a page, you may also want 
to limit the height of it. This is 
achieved using the min-height
and max-height properties.

** Overflowing content **
p.one {

overflow: hidden;}

p.two {

overflow: scroll;}

The overflow property tells the 
browser what to do if the content 
contained within a box is larger 
than the box itself. It can have 
one of two values:
hidden
This property simply hides any 
extra content that does not fit in 
the box.
scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to 
the box so that users can scroll 
to see the missing content.

## Border, Margin & Padding

![alt text](https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding-2.png?width=650&name=Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding-2.png "title")

** border-width **
p.one {

border-width: 2px;}

p.two {

border-width: thick;}

p.three {

border-width: 1px 4px 12px
 4px;//
 border-top-width ,
border-right-width,
border-bottom-width,
border-left-width,

 iven 
in pixels or using one of the 
following values:
thin,
medium,
thick.

** border-style **

p.one {border-style: solid;}
p.two {border-style: dotted;}
p.three {border-style: dashed;}
p.four {border-style: double;}
p.five {border-style: groove;}
p.six {border-style: ridge;}
p.seven {border-style: inset;}
p.eight {border-style: outset;

You can control the style of a 
border using the border-style
property. This property can take 
the following values:
solid a single solid line
dotted a series of square dots
(if your border is 2px wide, then 
the dots are 2px squared with a 
2px gap between each dot)
dashed a series of short lines
double two solid lines (the 
value of the border-width
property creates the sum of the 
two lines)
groove appears to be carved 
into the page
ridge appears to stick out from 
the page
inset appears embedded into 
the page
outset looks like it is coming 
out of the screen
hidden / none no border is 
shown
You can individually change the 
styles of different borders using:
border-top-style
border-left-style
border-right-style
border-bottom-style

** border-color **

p.one {
border-color: #0088dd;}
p.two {
border-color: #bbbbaa #111111 #ee3e80 #0088dd;}

You can specify the color of a 
border using

on different sides of a box using:
border-top-color
border-right-color
border-bottom-color
border-left-color

** shorthand border **

p {
width: 250px;
border: 3px dotted #0088dd;

The border property allows you 
to specify the width, style and 
color of a border in one property 
(and the values should be coded 
in that specific order


# js 
 ** USING QUOTES 
INSIDE A STRING**

if you just 
want to use double quotes in the 
string, you could surround the 
entire string in single quotes. 
If you just want to use single 
quotes in the string, you could 
surround the string in double 
quotes

** USING A VARIABLE TO 
STORE A BOOLEAN **

var i nStock; 

var shipping; 

inStock = true; 

shipping= false;

** SHORTHAND FOR 
CREATING VARIABLES **

* 
var price = 5; 

var quantity = 14;

var total = price * quantity; 

* 
var price, quantity, total ; 

price = 5;

quanti ty = 14 ; 

total = price * quantity;

* 
var price 
var total 
5, quantity = 14; 
price * quantity;

** COMPARI NG 
TWO EXPRESSIONS **

var comparison= (score!+ score2) > (highScorel + highScore2);

** IF STATEMENTS **

Use the if statement to specify a block of JavaScript code to be executed if a condition is true.

if (condition) {
  //  block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}

** SWITCH STATEMENTS **

A switch statement starts with a 
variable called the switch value. 
Each case indicates a possible 
value for this variable and the 
code that should run if the 
variable matches that value. 

switch (level) { 

case 'One ': 

title= 'Level 1 ' ;

break; 

case 'Two': 

tit 1 e = ' Level 2 ' ; 

break; 

case ' Three' : 

title = 'Level 3' ; 

break ; 

default : 

title= 'Test'; 

break;
