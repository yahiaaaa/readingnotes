*** JavaScript vs HTML
The difference between JavaScript and HTML is that HTML creates a basic structure of web pages by displaying the content in plain text whereas JavaScript makes the basic HTML web page look more dynamic and interactive. ***


- How people access the web ?

People access websites using software called a web browser. Popular examples include Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome, and Opera.

- What's the WEB Server ?

Web servers are special computers that hosts the web pages that are constantly connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pages out to people who request them

- How the Web Works ?

1- When you connect to the web, you do so via an Internet Service Provider (ISP). You type a domain name or web address into your browser to visit a site; for example: google.com, bbc.co.uk, microsoft.com.

2- Your computer contacts a network of servers called Domain Name System (DNS) servers. These act like phone books; they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name. An IP address is a number of up to 12 digits separated by periods / full stops. Every device connected to the web has a unique IP address; it is like the phone number for that computer

3- The unique number that the DNS server returns to your computer allows your browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested. A web server is a computer that is constantly connected to the web, and is set up especially to send web pages to users.

4- The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

** Structure **

we use the HTML to build the website structure

HTML pages are text documents

HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages

There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

Examples of html elements

Body

Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.*

Head

This contains information about the page (rather than information that is shown within the main part of the browser window

Title

The contents of the element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or on the tab for that page (if your browser uses tabs to allow you to view multiple pages at the same time).

How to create web page on your PC?

To create your first web page on a PC, start up Notepad. You can find this by going to:

Start All Programs (or Programs) Accessories Notepad
Type the code on the notepad.

Go to the File menu and select Save as... You will need to save the file somewhere you can remember. If you like, you could create a folder for any examples that you try out from this book. *Save this file as first-test. html. Make sure that the Save as type drop down has All Files selected.

Next, start your web browser, go to the File menu, and select Open. You should browse to the file that you just created, select it and click on the Open button.
Extra Markup
we have several different versions of HTML, so each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included).

HTML5
HTML 4
Transitional XHTML 1.0
Strict XHTML 1.0
XML Declaration
Comments in HTML

We use < !-- --> to add comments, Which is a good idea to add comments to your code because, no matter how familiar you are with the page at the time of writing it, when you come back to it later (or if someone else needs to look at the code), comments will make it much easier to understand, Although comments are not visible to users in the main browser window, they can be viewed by anyone who looks at the source code behind the page.

***ID Attribute***

Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character). It is important that no two elements on the same page have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique),For example, you might want to assign one paragraph within the page (perhaps a paragraph containing a pull quote) a different style than all of the other paragraphs,The id attribute is known as a global attribute because it can be used on any element

*** Class Attribute ***

Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page. For example, you might have some paragraphs of text that contain information that is more important than others and want to distinguish these elements, or you might want to differentiate between links that point to other pages on your own site and links that point to external sites. To do this you can use the class attribute. Its value should describe the class it belongs to

Block Elements

Elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window

Examples of block elements are:

< h1> , < p>, < ul>, and < li>.

Inline Eleme nts

elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements

Examples of inline elements are < a>, < b>, < em>, and < img>

Grouping Text & Elements In a Block

<div>
The <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box. For example, you might create a <div> element to contain all of the elements for the header of your site (the logo and the navigation), or you might create a <div> element to contain comments from visitors, In a browser, the contents of the <div> element will start on a new line, but other than this it will make no difference to the presentation of the page.

Grouping Text & Elements Inline

<span>

The <span> element acts like an inline equivalent of the
element. It is used to either:

Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text

Contain a number of inline elements

IFrames

<iframe>

An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline frame. One common use of iframes (that you may have seen on various websites) is to embed a Google Map into a page. The content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the same server or anywhere else on the web).

<meta>

The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page. It is not visible to users but fulfills a number of purposes such as telling search engines about your page, who created it, and whether or not it is time sensitive. (If the page is time sensitive, it can be set to expire.)

Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.

HTML5 Layout
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already

Headers & Footers <header> <footer>

The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:

The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page

Navigation <nav>

The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

Articles <article>

The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. This could be an individual article or blog entry, a comment or forum post, or any other independent piece of content. If a page contains several articles (or even summaries of several articles), then each individual article would live inside its own <article> element. The <article> elements can even be nested inside each other. For example, a blog post might live inside one <article> element and each comment on the article could live inside its own child <article> element.

Asides <aside>

The element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an element or not.

When the element is used inside an element, it should contain information that is related to the article but not essential to its overall meaning. For example, a pullquote or glossary might be considered as an aside to the article it relates to.

When the element is used outside of an element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page. For example, it might contain links to other sections of the site, a list of recent posts, a search box, or recent tweets by the author.

Sections <section>

The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading

Heading Groups <hgroup>

The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading

Figures <figure> <figcaption>

It can be used to contain any content that is referenced from the main flow of an article (not just images).

Examples of usage include:

Images

Videos

Graphs
Diagrams
Code samples
Text that supports the main body of an article
The <figure> element should also contain a <figcaption> element which provides a text decription for the content of the <figure> element. In this example, you can see a <figure> has been added inside the <article> element.

Sectioning Elements <div>

the <div> element will remain an important way to group together related elements, because you should not be using these new elements that you have just met for purposes other than those explicitly stated.

Linking Around Block-Level Elements

HTML5 allows web page authors to place an <a> element around a block level element that contains child elements. This allows you to turn an entire block into a link.

Helping Older Browsers Understand

Older browsers that do not know the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS " header, section, footer, aside, nav, article, figure { display: block;} "which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.

Also, IE9 was the first version of Internet Explorer to allow CSS rules to be associated with these new HTML5 layout elements. In order to style these elements using earlier versions of IE, yo need to use a simple JavaScript known as the HTML5 shiv or HTML5 shim.

You do not need to understand JavaScript to use it. You can just link to a copy that Google hosts on its servers. It should be placed inside a conditional comment which checks if the browser version is less than (hence the lt) IE9.

Unfortunately, this workaround does require that anyone using IE8 or earlier versions of IE has JavaScript enabled in their browser. If they do not have JavaScript enabled then they will not be able to see the content of these HTML5 elements.

Process and Design
Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.

So you have get answers for these Questions

Target Audience: individuals

What is the age range of your target audience?
Will your site appeal to more women or men? What is the mix?
Which country do your visitors live in?
Do they live in urban or rural areas?
What is the average income of visitors?
What level of education do they have?
What is their marital or family status?
What is their occupation?
How many hours do they work per week?
How often do they use the web?
What kind of device do they use to acces web pages?
Target Audience: Companies

What is the size of the company or relevant department?
What is the position of people in the company who visit your site?
Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
How large is the budget they control?
Why People Visit YOUR Website?

Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason.

To help determine why people are coming to your website, there are two basic categories of questions you can ask:

1: The first attempts to discover the underlying motivations for why visitors come to the site.

2: The second examines the specific goals of the visitors. These are the triggers making them come to the site now.

What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?

It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This information can help guide your site designs

What Information Your Visitors Need?

You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively,Here are some questions to help you decide what information to provide for visitors to your site

Will visitors be familiar with your subject area / brand or do you need to introduce yourself?
Will they be familiar with the product / service / information you are covering or do they need background information on it?
What are the most important features of what you are offering?
What is special about what you offer that differentiates you from other sites that offer something similar?
Once people have achieved the goal that sent them to your site, are there common questions people ask about this subject area?
How Often People Will Visit Your Site?

Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

A website about fashion trends will need to change a lot more frequently than one that is promoting a service that people do not buy regularly (such as domestic plumbing or double glazing).

Site Maps

it aims to create a diagram of the pages that will be used to structure the site.

To help you decide what information should go on each page, you can use a technique called card sorting.

The groups of information are then turned into the diagram that is known as the site map

WireFrames

A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

Visual hierarchy

Most web users do not read entire pages. Rather, they skim to find information. You can use contrast to create a visual hierarchy that gets across your key message and helps users find what they are looking for, To do that you shoud focus on:

Color
size
style
grouping and Similarity When making sense of a design, we tend to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved

Proximity
Closure
Continuance
White Space
color
Borders
The ABC Of Programming
What's Java Script ?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

WRITING A SCRIPT

To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.

Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps.

DEFINE THE GOAL

First, you need to define the task you want to achieve. You can think of this as a puzzle for the computer to solve.

DESIGN THE SCRIPT

To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks that are going to be involved in solving this puzzle. This can be represented using a flowchart. You can then write down individual steps that the computer needs to perform in order to complete each individual task (and any information it needs to perform the task), rather like writing a recipe that it can follow.

CODE EACH STEP

Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter understands. In our case, this is JavaScript. As tempting as it can be to start coding straight away, it pays to spend time designing your script before you start writing it

How computer fit with world around it ?

COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA
computer use objects to represent physical things
each object has proberties that Provide us with Info about object , method that perform tasks using the proberties of objects,events which is triggered when the user intract with the copmuter .
browsers use HTML to create a model for the web page and each elements creates its owen node "which a kinde of the object"

to make web pages ineractive you should write code the uses the browser's model for web page

how do write java script file for web pages?
there are three layers form the basis of a popular approach to building web pages called progressive enhancement.

CONTENT LAYER

This is where the content of the page lives. The HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.

PRESENTATION LAYER

The CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented (backgrounds, borders, box dimensions, colors, fonts, etc

BEHAVIOR LAYER

This is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity. We will aim to keep as much of our JavaScript as possible in separate files.

JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script

When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML <script> element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its src attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored.

You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening <script> and closing </script> tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files)
